Mobile Programming Project

A mobile application that will enable students to calculate grades and get on the track of them. 
The app will calculate the data that user enters (grade percentages and points), and show the results of the grades. 
The app will also show the percent-per-point ratio to show user where points have the biggest impact on the resultant grade. 
User will be allowed to save all the data, or just keep percentages as a template, so user can reuse the same percentages with 
different points.
When the app is opened the home screen pops up. The user can choose between two options, to create a new grade note, or to open 
the already saved ones. If the user chooses the first option, a little window with the question pops up: does the user wish to 
make a blank new note or to use one of the already saved templates, to put different points to the percentages that have been used 
before. The new grade screen shows up with textboxes where the user will enter the names and types of tasks, their grade 
percentage, and the points earned from the task. The app will calculate the data entered, and show the result of the grade, with 
the individual points that each task has earned them. The user will be able to save the result manually, or the reminder will show 
up if the user tries to close the note without saving. The user will be able to not save the data. User will be taken back to the
home screen again. If the user tries to close the app, small warning window pops up. The user can choose to exit and close the app, 
or to stay in app, on home screen.
